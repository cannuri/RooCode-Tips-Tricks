# Handoff System Rules

Suggest to user to create handoffs when context becomes stale, milestones when features complete, and epics when related milestones accumulate. For implementation details, refer to handoffs/0-instructions/.

## When to Create Documents

1. **Suggest to create handoffs when:**
   - Context becomes ~30% irrelevant to current task
   - After completing significant project segments
   - After 10+ conversation exchanges
   - During debugging sessions exceeding 5 exchanges without resolution

2. **Suggest to create milestones when:**
   - Completing major features or components
   - After 3-5 handoffs accumulate
   - A significant project phase concludes

3. **Suggest to create epics when:**
   - 2-4 related milestones accumulate
   - Major releases are completed
   - System capabilities span several milestones
   - Core architectural patterns emerge
   - Product capabilities reach maturity
   - Before a release

A fresh LLM session with focused context often solves problems that an overloaded session cannot.

Never create handoffs, milestones, or epics by yourself but always suggest to the user to do so.
