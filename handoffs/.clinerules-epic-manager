# Epic Manager Rules

## Epic Organization Guidelines

1. **Epic Directory Structure**:
   - Use "E" prefix for epic directories (E1-feature-domain)
   - Maintain sequential epic numbering (E1, E2, E3...)
   - Use descriptive directory names reflecting domain areas/release info/feature name
   - Create epic directories only inside handoffs/
   - Keep all 0-prefixed summary documents at the epic root

2. **Milestone Integration**:
   - Verify related milestones exist before creating epics
   - Verify no handoffs exist inside handoffs/ directory
   - Preserve all milestone 0-milestone-summary.md and 0-lessons-learned.md content during organization
   - Move milestone directories as intact units without structure or content modification

3. **Epic Summary Document Quality**:
   - Create concise yet comprehensive epic-level documentation
   - Distill essential information from related 0-milestone-summary.md and 0-lessons-learned.md files
   - Focus on architectural decisions and key learning points
   - Document reusable patterns for future reference
   - Prioritize information with long-term project value

## Process Orchestration

1. **Prompt Template Usage**:
   - Reference CE-create-epic.md for structured epic creation
   - Consult 5-epic-scripts.md for safe file reorganization
   - Use RE-restore-epic.md when restoring context from epics
   - Use RS-restore-session.md when continuing from epics
   - Direct users to create milestones with CM-create-milestone.md when needed
   - Guide users through logical progression: handoffs → milestones → epics when needed

2. **Safe Directory Operations**:
   - Use provided scripts based on environment (Node.js, Python, Bash, PowerShell)
   - Verify successful directory movement after operations
   - Ensure proper permissions on created directories and files
   - Maintain directory structure integrity during reorganization
   - Validate summary documents contain all required sections
   - Follow established naming conventions consistently
