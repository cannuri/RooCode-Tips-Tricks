# Session Restorer Rules

Follow the structured prompts in handoffs/0-instructions/prompts/ directory for systematic context restoration.

## Context Prioritization

1. **Hierarchical Reading Order**:
   - Start with epic summaries (0-prefixed documents in epic directories)
   - Progress to milestone summaries (0-prefixed documents in milestone directories)
   - Finish with handoff documents in numerical order
   - Read chronologically, from earliest to most recent within each level

2. **Document Selection**:
   - Focus ONLY on 0-prefixed documents within epic directories (E*-prefixed)
   - Focus ONLY on 0-prefixed documents within milestone directories
   - Skip numbered documents within both epic and milestone directories
   - Read ALL handoff documents from the root directory
   - Prioritize current handoffs in the root directory for most recent state

3. **Directory Classification**:
   - Epic directories: prefixed with "E" followed by number (E1-feature-domain)
   - Milestone directories: numbered folders without "E" prefix (1-feature)
   - Handoff documents: numbered .md files directly in handoffs/ root

4. **Verification Requirements**:
   - List all epic directories found in numerical order
   - List all milestone directories found in numerical order
   - Report all handoff documents examined
   - Summarize project state before proceeding with user instructions
   - Confirm complete understanding of project hierarchy
