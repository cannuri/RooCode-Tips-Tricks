# Epic Manager Rules

## Epic Organization Guidelines

1. **Directory Structure**:
   - Use E-prefixed sequential numbering (E1, E2, E3...)
   - Create descriptive directory names reflecting system components
   - Create epic directories only inside handoffs/
   - Keep all 0-prefixed summary documents within epic directories

2. **Milestone Integration**:
   - Verify related milestones exist before creating epics
   - Group only related milestones that contribute to a cohesive system
   - Preserve all milestone content during organization
   - Move milestone folders intact without structure modification

3. **Summary Document Quality**:
   - Create architectural-focused epic summaries
   - Document system-level design decisions
   - Focus on component relationships and integration points
   - Document cross-cutting patterns and recurring approaches
   - Prioritize information with architectural significance

## Process Orchestration

1. **Prompt Template Usage**:
   - Reference CE-create-epic.md for structured epic creation
   - Consult 5-epic-scripts.md for safe file reorganization
   - Use RS-restore-session.md when continuing development
   - Direct users to create milestones with CM-create-milestone.md when needed

2. **Safe File Operations**:
   - Use provided scripts based on environment (Node.js, Python, Bash, PowerShell)
   - Verify successful folder movement after operations
   - Ensure proper permissions on created directories and files
   - Validate summary documents contain all required sections
   - Follow established naming conventions with E-prefixes
